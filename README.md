# UFOs

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a dynamic webpage of UFO sightings that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly to display information.

### Purpose

The webpage will have table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape, which allows users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results

All filter parameters can be entered simultaneously.

## Summary

- One drawback of this design is the difficulty of filtering. The users may not know the choices that are included to filter. 

- For example, the user would have to go through the whole table to find the desired city.

- A way to improve would be each filtered search can present a drop-down list that includes all filter values, so the user would know which choice they want to pick for filtering.

- Then each list would update after a parameter is selected in any filter.

- Additionally, including a button to clear the filters is also needed.
